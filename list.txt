However, most existing methods retrieve\nonly short contiguous chunks from a retrieval corpus, limiting holistic under-\nstanding of the overall document context. We introduce the novel approach of\nrecursively embedding, clustering, and summarizing chunks of text, constructing\na tree with differing levels of summarization from the bottom up.

Nevertheless, even a large model does not contain sufficient domain-\nspecific knowledge for particular tasks and the world continues to change, invalidating facts in the\nLLM. Updating the knowledge of these models through additional fine-tuning or editing is difficult,\nparticularly when dealing with vast text corpora (Lewis et al., 2020; Mitchell et al., 2022). An alter-', 'particularly when dealing with vast text corpora (Lewis et al., 2020; Mitchell et al., 2022). An alter-\nnative approach, pioneered in open domain question answering systems (Chen et al., 2017; Yu et al.,\n2018), is to index large quantities of text, after splitting it into chunks (paragraphs), in a separate\ninformation retrieval system. Retrieved information is then presented to the LLM along with the\nquestion as context (“retrieval augmentation”, Lewis et al., 2020; Izacard et al., 2022; Min et al.,\n2023; Ram et al., 2023), making it easy to provide a system with current knowledge particular to\nsome domain and enabling easy interpretability and provenance tracking, whereas the parametric\nknowledge of LLMs is opaque and difficult to trace back to its source (Akyurek et al., 2022).', 'knowledge of LLMs is opaque and difficult to trace back to its source (Akyurek et al., 2022).\nNevertheless, existing retrieval-augmented approaches also have flaws. The one we tackle is that\nmost existing methods retrieve only a few short, contiguous text chunks, which limits their ability\nto represent and leverage large-scale discourse structure. This is particularly relevant for thematic\nquestions that require integrating knowledge from multiple parts of a text, such as understanding\nan entire book, as in the NarrativeQA dataset (Ko ˇcisk`y et al., 2018). Consider the fairy tale of\nCinderella, and the question “How did Cinderella reach her happy ending?”.

Controlled experiments with three language models (UnifiedQA (Khashabi et al., 2020),\nGPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) and GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023)) show that RAPTOR outperforms current\nretrieval augmentation.

Recent advances in hardware and algorithms have indeed expanded the con-\ntext lengths that models can handle, leading to questions about the need for retrieval systems (Dai\net al., 2019; Dao et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2023). However, as Liu et al. (2023) and Sun et al. (2021)\nhave noted, models tend to underutilize long-range context and see diminishing performance as con-', 'have noted, models tend to underutilize long-range context and see diminishing performance as con-\ntext length increases, especially when pertinent information is embedded within a lengthy context.\nMoreover, practically, use of long contexts is expensive and slow. This suggests that selecting the\nmost relevant information for knowledge-intensive tasks is still crucial.\nRetrieval Methods Retrieval-augmented language models (RALMs) have seen improvements in\nvarious components: the retriever, the reader, and end-to-end system training. Retrieval methods\nhave transitioned from traditional term-based techniques like TF-IDF (Sp¨arck Jones, 1972) and\nBM25 (Robertson et al., 1995; Roberts et al., 2020) to deep learning–based strategies (Karpukhin\net al., 2020; Khattab & Zaharia, 2020; Sachan et al., 2023). Some recent work proposes using', 'large language models as retrievers due to their ability to memorize extensive knowledge (Yu et al.,\n2022; Sun et al., 2022). Research on the reader component includes Fusion-in-Decoder (FiD)\n(Izacard & Grave, 2022), which employs both DPR and BM25 for retrieval and processes passages\nindependently in the encoder and RETRO (Borgeaud et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023), which utilizes\ncross-chunked attention and chunkwise retrieval to generate text grounded on retrieved context.\nEnd-to-end system training work includes Atlas (Izacard et al., 2022), which fine-tunes an encoder-\ndecoder model in conjunction with the retriever; REALM (Guu et al., 2020), a bidirectional, masked\nLM fine-tuned for open-domain question answering; and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Genera-', 'LM fine-tuned for open-domain question answering; and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Genera-\ntion) (Lewis et al., 2020), which integrates pre-trained sequence-to-sequence models with a neural\nretriever. Min et al. (2021) introduced Joint Passage Retrieval (JPR) model which uses a tree-\ndecoding algorithm to handle passage diversity and relevance in multi-answer retrieval. Dense Hi-\nerarchical Retrieval (DHR) andHybrid Hierarchical Retrieval (HHR) represent advancements\nin retrieval accuracy by combining document and passage level retrievals and integrating sparse and\ndense retrieval methods, respectively (Liu et al., 2021; Arivazhagan et al., 2023).\n1We will release the code of RAPTOR publicly here.\n2', 'Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nDespite a diversity in methods, the retrieving components of models predominantly rely on stan-\ndard approaches, i.e., chunking corpora and encoding with BERT-based retrievers. Although this\napproach is widely adopted, Nair et al. (2023) highlights a potential shortcoming: contiguous seg-\nmentation might not capture the complete semantic depth of the text. Reading extracted snippets\nfrom technical or scientific documents may lack important context making them difficult to read or\neven misleading. (Cohan & Goharian, 2017; Newman et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023).\nRecursive summarization as Context Summarization techniques provide a condensed view of\ndocuments, enabling more focused engagement with the content (Angelidis & Lapata, 2018).

(2021) employs task decomposition\nto summarize smaller text chunks, which are later integrated to form summaries of larger sections.\nWhile this method is effective for capturing broader themes, it can miss granular details. LlamaIndex\n(Liu, 2022) mitigates this issue by similarly summarizing adjacent text chunks but also retaining\nintermediate nodes thus storing varying levels of detail, keeping granular details. However, both\nmethods, due to their reliance on adjacency for grouping or summarizing adjacent nodes, may still', 'methods, due to their reliance on adjacency for grouping or summarizing adjacent nodes, may still\noverlook distant interdependencies within the text, which we can find and group with RAPTOR.\n3 M ETHODS\nOverview of RAPTOR Building on the idea that long texts often present subtopics and hierarchi-\ncal structures (Cao & Wang, 2022; Dong et al., 2023b), RAPTOR addresses the issue of semantic\ndepth and connection in reading by building a recursive tree structure that balances broader thematic\ncomprehension with granular details and which allows nodes to be grouped based on semantic sim-\nilarity not just order in the text.\nConstruction of the RAPTOR tree begins with segmenting the retrieval corpus into short, contiguous\ntexts of length 100, similar to traditional retrieval augmentation techniques. If a sentence exceeds the', 'texts of length 100, similar to traditional retrieval augmentation techniques. If a sentence exceeds the\n100-token limit, we move the entire sentence to the next chunk, rather than cutting it mid-sentence.\nThis preserves the contextual and semantic coherence of the text within each chunk. These texts\nare then embedded using SBERT, a BERT-based encoder ( multi-qa-mpnet-base-cos-v1 )\n(Reimers & Gurevych, 2019). The chunks and their corresponding SBERT embeddings form the\nleaf nodes of our tree structure.\nTo group similar text chunks, we employ a clustering algorithm. Once clustered, a Language Model\nis used to summarize the grouped texts. These summarized texts are then re-embedded, and the cycle\nof embedding, clustering, and summarization continues until further clustering becomes infeasible,\nresulting in a structured, multi-layered tree representation of the original documents. An important', 'resulting in a structured, multi-layered tree representation of the original documents. An important\naspect of RAPTOR is its computational efficiency. The system scales linearly in terms of both build\ntime and token expenditure, making it suitable for processing large and complex corpora. For a\ncomprehensive discussion on RAPTOR’s scalability, please refer to the Appendix A.\nFor querying within this tree, we introduce two distinct strategies: tree traversal and collapsed tree.\nThe tree traversal method traverses the tree layer-by-layer, pruning and selecting the most relevant\nnodes at each level. The collapsed tree method evaluates nodes collectively across all layers to find\nthe most relevant ones.\nClustering Algorithm Clustering plays a key role in building the RAPTOR tree, organizing text\nsegments into cohesive groups. This step groups related content together, which helps the subse-\nquent retrieval process.', 'segments into cohesive groups. This step groups related content together, which helps the subse-\nquent retrieval process.\nOne of the unique aspects of our clustering approach is the use of soft clustering, where nodes can\nbelong to multiple clusters without requiring a fixed number of clusters. This flexibility is essen-\ntial because individual text segments often contain information relevant to various topics, thereby\nwarranting their inclusion in multiple summaries.\nOur clustering algorithm is based on Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), an approach that offers\nboth flexibility and a probabilistic framework. GMMs assume that data points are generated from a\nmixture of several Gaussian distributions.\n3', 'Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nGiven a set of Ntext segments, each represented as a d-dimensional dense vector embedding, the\nlikelihood of a text vector, x, given its membership in the kthGaussian distribution, is denoted by\nP(x|k) =N(x;µk,Σk). The overall probability distribution is a weighted combination P(x) =PK\nk=1πkN(x;µk,Σk), where πksignifies the mixture weight for the kthGaussian distribution.\nThe high dimensionality of vector embeddings presents a challenge for traditional GMMs, as dis-\ntance metrics may behave poorly when used to measure similarity in high-dimensional spaces (Ag-\ngarwal et al., 2001). To mitigate this, we employ Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection', 'garwal et al., 2001). To mitigate this, we employ Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection\n(UMAP), a manifold learning technique for dimensionality reduction (McInnes et al., 2018). The\nnumber of nearest neighbors parameter, nneighbors , in UMAP determines the balance between\nthe preservation of local and global structures. Our algorithm varies nneighbors to create a hierar-\nchical clustering structure: it first identifies global clusters and then performs local clustering within\nthese global clusters. This two-step clustering process captures a broad spectrum of relationships\namong the text data, from broad themes to specific details.\nShould a local cluster’s combined context ever exceed the summarization model’s token threshold,\nour algorithm recursively applies clustering within the cluster, ensuring that the context remains\nwithin the token threshold.\nTo determine the optimal number of clusters, we employ the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)', 'within the token threshold.\nTo determine the optimal number of clusters, we employ the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)\nfor model selection.

In the context of GMM, the number of parameters k\nis a function of the dimensionality of the input vectors and the number of clusters.\nWith the optimal number of clusters determined by BIC, the Expectation-Maximization algorithm\nis then used to estimate the GMM parameters, namely the means, covariances, and mixture weights.', 'is then used to estimate the GMM parameters, namely the means, covariances, and mixture weights.\nWhile the Gaussian assumption in GMMs may not perfectly align with the nature of text data, which\noften exhibits a sparse and skewed distribution, our empirical observations suggest that it offers an\neffective model for our purpose. We run an ablation comparing GMM Clustering with summarizing\ncontiguous chunks and provide details in Appendix B.\nModel-Based Summarization After clustering the nodes using Gaussian Mixture Models, the\nnodes in each cluster are sent to a language model for summarization. This step allows the model\nto transform large chunks of text into concise, coherent summaries of the selected nodes. For our\nexperiments, we use gpt-3.5-turbo to generate the summaries.

These did not propagate\nto parent nodes and had no discernible impact on question-answering tasks. For an in-depth analysis\nof hallucinations, refer to the appendix E.\nQuerying In this section, we elaborate on the two querying mechanisms employed by RAPTOR:\ntree traversal and collapsed tree.

This process is repeated until we reach the leaf nodes. Finally, the text from all selected\nnodes is concatenated to form the retrieved context. The algorithm’s steps are outlined below:\n1.

However, during retrieval, we limit the search to different subsets of layers. For example,\nwe exclusively retrieve from the leaf nodes and each upper layer, as well as from different contiguous\nsubsets of the layers. We show findings specific to one story in Table 8, revealing that a full-tree\nsearch, utilizing all layers, outperformed retrieval strategies that focused only on specific layers.\nThese findings highlight the importance of the full tree structure in RAPTOR.

By employing recursive clustering and summarization techniques, RAPTOR creates a\nhierarchical tree structure that is capable of synthesizing information across various sections of the\nretrieval corpora. During the query phase, RAPTOR leverages this tree structure for more effective\nretrieval. Our controlled experiments demonstrated that RAPTOR not only outperforms traditional\nretrieval methods but also sets new performance benchmarks on several question-answering tasks.\n9', 'Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\n6 R EPRODUCIBILITY STATEMENT\nLanguage Models for QA and Summarization Four language models are used in our RAPTOR\nexperiments: GPT-3 and GPT-4 for QA tasks, and GPT-3.5-turbo for summarization.

The paper introduces a novel approach to retrieval-augmented language models, which can better adapt to changes in world state and incorporate long-tail knowledge.\n\nHere is a summary of the documentation:\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe paper begins by introducing the concept of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their limitations in utilizing long-range context and seeing diminishing performance as context length increases. The authors highlight the importance of selecting the most relevant information for knowledge-intensive tasks.\n\n**Retrieval Methods**\n\nThe paper discusses various retrieval methods, including traditional term-based techniques and deep learning-based strategies. It also mentions recent advancements in retrieval accuracy, such as Joint Passage Retrieval (JPR), Dense Hierarchical Retrieval (DHR), and Hybrid Hierarchical Retrieval (HHR).\n\n**RAPTOR Model**\n\nThe authors introduce the RAPTOR model, which recursively embeds, clusters, and summarizes text chunks to construct a tree with differing levels of summarization from the bottom up. At inference time, the model retrieves from this tree, integrating information across lengthy documents at different levels of abstraction.\n\n**Tree Structure**\n\nThe paper explains how the RAPTOR model constructs a tree structure by grouping similar text chunks using a clustering algorithm. The chunks are then summarized using a Language Model, and the process is repeated until further clustering becomes infeasible, resulting in a structured, multi-layered tree representation of the original documents.\n\n**Experimental Results**\n\nThe authors present experimental results that show significant improvements over traditional retrieval-augmented LMs on several tasks, including question-answering tasks that involve complex, multi-step reasoning.

The authors also mention that they will release the code of RAPTOR publicly, making it available for further research and development.', 'The provided documentation discusses the LangChain Expression Language, which allows for composing chains in LangChain. The documentation is focused on the limitations of large language models (LLMs) and the need for alternative approaches to update their knowledge.\n\nThe main points discussed in the documentation are:\n\n1. LLMs have limited domain-specific knowledge and are prone to obsolescence due to the rapid change in the world.\n2. Updating the knowledge of LLMs through fine-tuning or editing is difficult, especially when dealing with vast text corpora.\n3. An alternative approach is to index large quantities of text in a separate information retrieval system and present the retrieved information to the LLM along with the question as context (retrieval augmentation).\n4. Existing retrieval-augmented approaches have limitations, such as only retrieving a few short, contiguous text chunks, which limits their ability to represent and leverage large-scale discourse structure.\n5. To address this, the authors design an indexing and retrieval system that uses a tree structure to capture both the local and global context of the text.\n6. The proposed approach outperforms existing methods on three QA tasks: free text response questions on books and movies, full-text NLP papers, and multiple-choice questions based on medium-length passages.\n7. The authors also discuss related work in retrieval and reader components, including Fusion-in-Decoder (FiD), RETRO, Atlas, REALM, and RAG.\n8. The retrieving components of models predominantly rely on standard approaches, such as chunking corpora and encoding with BERT-based retrievers, but these approaches may not capture the complete semantic depth of the text.\n\nOverall, the documentation highlights the limitations of LLMs and the need for alternative approaches to update their knowledge, and proposes a new method for indexing and retrieving text that can capture both local and global context.', 'Here is a detailed summary of the documentation provided:\n\nThe documentation describes a novel tree-based retrieval system called RAPTOR, which is designed to address the issue of semantic depth and connection in reading by building a recursive tree structure. The system uses a combination of clustering and summarization techniques to create a hierarchical tree structure that balances broader thematic comprehension with granular details.\n\nThe system consists of several components:\n\n1. **Indexing and Retrieval**: RAPTOR uses a tree structure to capture both high-level and low-level details about a text. The system clusters chunks of text, generates text summaries of those clusters, and then repeats, generating a tree from the bottom up.\n2. **Construction of the RAPTOR Tree**: The tree is constructed by segmenting the retrieval corpus into short, contiguous texts of length 100, similar to traditional retrieval augmentation techniques.\n3. **Querying**: RAPTOR employs two querying mechanisms: tree traversal and collapsed tree. These methods offer unique ways of traversing the multi-layered RAPTOR tree to retrieve relevant information, each with its own advantages and trade-offs.\n4. **Embedding**: All nodes are embedded using SBERT.\n5. **Evaluation**: The system is evaluated on several question-answering tasks, and the results show that it outperforms traditional retrieval methods and sets new performance benchmarks.\n\nThe documentation also includes:\n\n* **Ablation Study on Clustering Mechanism**: An ablation study is conducted to assess the effectiveness of the clustering mechanism in RAPTOR.\n* **Hallucination Analysis**: An analysis is conducted to assess the quality and accuracy of the summarizations within the RAPTOR model, focusing on hallucinations in the generated summaries.\n\nOverall, the documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the RAPTOR system, its components, and its evaluation, as well as an analysis of its performance and limitations.', 'Based on the provided documentation, here is a detailed summary of the LangChain Expression Language:\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe LangChain Expression Language is a way to compose chains in LangChain. The language enables the construction of a hierarchical summarization model, RAPTOR, which recursively clusters chunks of text based on their vector embeddings and generates text summaries of those clusters.\n\n**Mathematical Formulation**\n\nThe RAPTOR model is based on a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) with a weighted combination of Gaussian distributions. The likelihood of a text vector, x, given its membership in the kth Gaussian distribution, is denoted by P(x|k) = N(x;µk,Σk). The overall probability distribution is P(x) = ∑k=1πkN(x;µk,Σk), where πk signifies the mixture weight for the kth Gaussian distribution.\n\n**Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection**\n\nTo mitigate the challenge of high-dimensional vector embeddings, the authors employ Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection.\n\n**Ablation Study**\n\nAn ablation study was conducted to compare RAPTOR with a recency-based tree approach. The results show that RAPTOR outperforms the recency-based tree approach with an accuracy of 56.6% compared to 55.8%.\n\n**Dataset Statistics and Compression Ratios**\n\nThe authors provide statistics on the average summary length, child node length, and compression ratio across all datasets. The average compression ratio is 72%, indicating that the summaries are significantly shorter than the original text.\n\n**Summarization Prompt**\n\nThe prompt used for summarization is as follows: "You are a Summarizing Text Portal. Write a summary of the following, including as many key details as possible: {context}."\n\n**Hallucination Analysis**\n\nTo assess the quality and accuracy of the summarizations, the authors conducted an analysis of hallucinations. They found that 4% of the nodes contained some form of hallucination, which was primarily caused by the model adding minor information or incorrectly extrapolating information.\n\n**Tree Construction Process**\n\nThe RAPTOR model constructs a hierarchical tree by recursively clustering chunks of text based on their vector embeddings. The authors provide a diagram (Figure 1) illustrating the tree construction process.\n\n**Node Retrieval**\n\nThe authors also provide a histogram (Figure 7) showing the percentage of nodes retrieved from different layers of the RAPTOR tree across three datasets. The data indicate that a substantial portion of the nodes contributing to the final retrieval comes from non-leaf layers.\n\n**Querying Different Layers of the Tree**\n\nThe authors provide a table (Table 15) showing the performance of RAPTOR when querying different layers of the tree for a specific story. The results indicate that querying the first and second layers can improve the performance of the model.', "The documentation provided is for a natural language processing (NLP) technique called RAPTOR, which is a method for clustering and summarizing text data. Here is a detailed summary of the documentation:\n\n**Overview**: RAPTOR is a technique for clustering and summarizing text data using a combination of Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) and language models. The goal is to group related text segments together and generate concise summaries of each group.\n\n**Methodology**: The RAPTOR algorithm consists of three main steps:\n\n1. **Clustering**: The algorithm uses GMMs to cluster text segments based on their semantic similarity. The clustering process is done using a two-step approach: first, it identifies global clusters and then performs local clustering within these global clusters.\n2. **Summarization**: Each node in the cluster is sent to a language model (in this case, gpt-3.5-turbo) for summarization. The summarization step condenses the potentially large volume of retrieved information into a manageable size.\n3. **Tree construction**: The clusters are represented as a tree structure, where each node represents a cluster and the edges represent the relationships between clusters.\n\n**Unique features**:\n\n* **Soft clustering**: RAPTOR uses soft clustering, which allows nodes to belong to multiple clusters without requiring a fixed number of clusters.\n* **Gaussian Mixture Models**: RAPTOR uses GMMs, which offer a probabilistic framework for clustering and allow for flexibility in the number of clusters.\n\n**Evaluation**: The algorithm is evaluated using three language models (UnifiedQA, GPT-3, and GPT-4) and three QA tasks. The results show that RAPTOR outperforms current retrieval augmentation methods and achieves new state-of-the-art results on three QA tasks.\n\n**Ablation study**: The documentation includes an ablation study that compares RAPTOR's clustering mechanism with a recency-based tree approach. The results show that RAPTOR's clustering mechanism is more effective in capturing homogeneous content for summarization, thereby enhancing the overall retrieval performance.\n\n**Technical details**:\n\n* **UMAP**: RAPTOR uses Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for dimensionality reduction.\n* **BIC**: The algorithm uses the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) for model selection to determine the optimal number of clusters.\n* **Expectation-Maximization algorithm**: The algorithm uses the Expectation-Maximization algorithm to estimate the GMM parameters.\n\nOverall, the documentation provides a detailed overview of the RAPTOR algorithm, its methodology, and its evaluation.

The tree traversal method traverses the tree layer-by-layer, pruning and selecting the most relevant nodes at each level. The collapsed tree method evaluates nodes collectively across all layers to find the most relevant ones.\n4. **Clustering algorithm**: RAPTOR uses a clustering algorithm to organize text segments into cohesive groups, which helps the subsequent retrieval process.\n5. **Comparison of query strategies**: The documentation compares the performance of tree traversal and collapsed tree methods, concluding that collapsed tree retrieval performs better due to its ability to search through all nodes simultaneously, retrieving information at the correct level of granularity.\n\nThe documentation also presents the following:\n\n* A qualitative study comparing RAPTOR's retrieval process to Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) methods using a 1500-word Cinderella fairytale.\n* An empirical investigation of the relationship between document length and token expenditure during the tree-building process.\n* A detailed analysis of the layers from which retrieved nodes originate, showing that a significant percentage of nodes come from non-leaf nodes.\n\nOverall, the documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the RAPTOR system, its features, and its performance, highlighting its scalability, querying strategies, and clustering algorithm.", "The LangChain Expression Langauge documentation provides a detailed explanation of two methods for retrieving relevant information from a RAPTOR tree: the tree traversal method and the collapsed tree approach.\n\nTree Traversal Method:\n\n* The method starts by computing the cosine similarity between the query embedding and the embeddings of all nodes present at the initial layer of the RAPTOR tree.\n* The top-k nodes with the highest cosine similarity scores are selected, forming the set S1.\n* The process is repeated recursively for d layers, producing sets S1, S2, ..., Sd.\n* The text from all selected nodes is concatenated to form the retrieved context.\n\nAlgorithm 1 provides the pseudocode for the tree traversal algorithm, which takes as input the RAPTOR tree, the query, and the number of nodes k to select at each layer.\n\nCollapsed Tree Approach:\n\n* The method collapses the entire RAPTOR tree into a single layer, creating a new set of nodes C.\n* The cosine similarity between the query embedding and the embeddings of all nodes in the collapsed set C is calculated.\n* The top-k nodes with the highest cosine similarity scores are selected, and nodes are added to the result set until a maximum number of tokens is reached.\n\nAlgorithm 2 provides the pseudocode for the collapsed tree algorithm, which takes as input the RAPTOR tree, the query, the number of nodes k to select, and the maximum number of tokens.\n\nThe documentation also provides a summary of the performance of both methods on a subset of the QASPER dataset, demonstrating that the collapsed tree approach produces better results.\n\nAdditionally, the documentation includes a qualitative analysis of the RAPTOR's retrieval process, testing it on thematic, multi-hop questions.
